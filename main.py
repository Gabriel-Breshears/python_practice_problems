# Hello Fellow Pythonista! Here are some practice problems for today

# Press Shift+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code.
# Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.



# 1. What will print to the console? another way to think about it, What will show up on the screen when you hit run?

favorite_artist = 'Taylor Swift'

print(favorite_artist)    #the print() function is what displays content on the screen.

# 2. What will print to the console now?

favorite_artist = 'Taylor Swift'
favorite_artist = 'Oliver Tree'

print(favorite_artist)


# 3. You can assign variables the value of other variables
# What will print to the console?

edward_favorite_color = 'red'
al_favorite_color = 'blue'

edward_favorite_color = al_favorite_color

print(edward_favorite_color)



# 4 .  Look at the variables defined below:

a = 50
b = 5
c = 10


# Put the lines in the correct order to reach the following results:
# Another way to phrase the question, assign the variables the values of the other variables to reach the result below

a = 5
b = 50
c = 5


# 5. What variable names are acceptable?
#
# Print one or more options from the list that have acceptable variable names.

 my_name = 'Bob'

 _joke = 'knock, knock...'

 gr8 = 'great'

 50cent = 'the rapper or an amount of money'

# 6.Choose the lines that do NOT contain errors.

a. PRINT("Hello, World!")

b. print("Hello, World!"

c. print(Hello, World!)

d. print("Hello, World!")

e. print('Hello, World!')


# 7. Write a program that prints the string "My name is " followed by your name like in the output example. All words in this string must be separated by a single space.

# Output example
#
# My name is John

# 8. The title of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is often shortened to Alice in Wonderland.
# Print the full title Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
# Hint there are two ways to create strings in python



# 9. Write a program that prints the following line.
# 2 + 2 = 4



#10 Try to solve this first before hitting run to check. Which print statements will crash your program / return an error.
#
 print("The ship's name is 'Brave'.")

print('Cat's paws.')

print('The word "Ciao" means "hello" in Italian.')

print("And "Ciao" is Italian "Bye".")


def print_hi(name):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(f'Hi, {name}')  # Press Ctrl+F8 to toggle the breakpoint.


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_hi('PyCharm')
